#Assignment 04: 

'''
We are not going to develop new functionality in this assignment. 
Rather, we are going to refactor existing code to improve it and make 
it more Pythonic. This is a very common activity in application 
development.

You will already have tests from the lesson 3 assignment that verify 
data is being written to the HP Norton databases. Although we are going 
to change the way data is written to and read from the databases
, the tests should not need to change. 
We are amending the functionality the tests use to make them easier to 
maintain and be more Pythonic.

This development process, where we change internal behavior while 
preserving how that behavior is called, is named refactoring.

So here is our refactoring assignment:

Using comprehensions, iterators / iterables, and generators appropriately
, and the instructor-provided customer data, write data to your customer 
database and read / display it.

Verify existing unit tests still function correctly.
If necessary, update your tests to show the data is being maintained 
correctly in the database.
Add code to log all database data changes (adds, amends, deletes) to a 
file called db.log.
Be sure to consult the lesson 3 assignment for details of the 
functionality.

Submit
You will need to submit basic_operations.py plus any test files you 
develop.
