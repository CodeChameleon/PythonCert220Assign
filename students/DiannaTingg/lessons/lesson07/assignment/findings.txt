I refactored the code from Lesson 05, so now the program returns a list of two tuples, one for customers and one for products.
Each tuple contains: number of records processed, record count in the database prior to running, record count after running, and time taken to run the module.

I'm using larger csv files for products, customers, and rentals.  Each file has 9,999 records plus a header row.
I automatically clear the MongoDB each time the program exits.

Using timeit, my linear.py file takes 3.205835777 seconds to run once.  It takes 28.792096512999997 seconds to run 10 times.
I wrote some tests in test_linear.py and they all pass.

I'm going to use multithreading in my parallel.py file to see if I can get a performance improvement.
I will read all three csv files at the same time (in parallel).
